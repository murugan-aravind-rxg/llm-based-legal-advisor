      "1. Responsibilities of each party will be determined as the project progresses.\n",
      "2. ABC Corp has the discretion to terminate the contract at any time.\n",

      "\n",
      "The provided agreement between ABC Corp and XYZ Ltd. poses several legal risks, which can be categorized as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Lack of Clear Responsibilities**: The agreement states that the responsibilities of each party shall be determined as the project progresses. This ambiguity can lead to:\n",
      "\t* Disputes and misunderstandings between the parties regarding their respective obligations.\n",
      "\t* Difficulty in establishing liability in case of project delays, defects, or other issues.\n",
      "\t* Potential breach of contract claims due to unclear expectations.\n",
      "2. **Unilateral Termination Clause**: The agreement allows ABC Corp to terminate the contract at its discretion, which may be considered an unfair contractual term. This can lead to:\n",
      "\t* XYZ Ltd. being left without recourse or compensation in case of termination.\n",
      "\t* Potential claims for unfair dismissal or breach of contract.\n",
      "3. **Insufficient Data Protection Provisions**: The agreement does not mention specific provisions regarding data protection or compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This can result in:\n",
      "\t* Non-compliance with GDPR, leading to significant fines and reputational damage.\n",
      "\t* Liability for data breaches or unauthorized use of personal data.\n",
      "\t* Inadequate protection of sensitive information, potentially harming both parties and their customers.\n",
      "4. **Regulatory Non-Compliance**: The lack of GDPR compliance provisions may also lead to:\n",
      "\t* Regulatory investigations and enforcement actions.\n",
      "\t* Damage to the parties' reputation and loss of customer trust.\n",
      "\t* Potential liability for non-compliance with other relevant regulations, such as data protection laws in other jurisdictions.\n",
      "5. **Contractual Imbalance**: The agreement's terms, particularly the unilateral termination clause, may be considered unfair and create an imbalance between the parties. This can lead to:\n",
      "\t* Claims for unfair contract terms under relevant laws, such as the Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA) in the UK.\n",
      "\t* Potential renegotiation of the contract terms or termination of the agreement.\n",

      "1. Clear and specific responsibilities for each party.\n",
      "2. Mutual termination provisions or a more balanced termination clause.\n",
      "3. Comprehensive data protection provisions, including GDPR compliance.\n",
